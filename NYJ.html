        <br>
        <br>
        Trevor Noah narrates his story through his upbringing in South Africa during <br>apartheid by his single mother.
        <br>
        <br>
        
         <b>Chapter 1:  Run</b>
         <br>
         <br>
        
        
        Trevor Noah explains apartheid which exploits the tribal differences among the South <br>Africans, the Zulu who were the warrior people, and the Xhosa who termed <br>themselves as thinkers. The Zulu fought the colonial armies while the Xhosa tried <br>learning from them.

        Trevor’s mother turns to Christianity where she figures that going to more churches <br>would get her more blessings because they faced challenges due to the racial <br>segregation caused by apartheid. Being raised in a Christian household, Trevor  <br>doesn't understand why  they should go to church every Sunday.  Trevor’s mother is <br>governed by church and she can't listen to any of Trevor’s excuses to not go to <br>church. She  is determined to protect her son and keep him safe ; she throws him out <br>of a moving car to save him from a gang attack.
        This is seen in African parents who do <br>anything just to protect their children.
        <br>

         <b>Chapter 2: Born A Crime</b>
         <br>
         <br>
        Trevor witnessed violence among South Africans trying to figure out which group <br>would rule the country at a young age when Nelson Mandela was released from <br>prison. Trevor was born to a white father and a black mother, which was illegal at <br>that time.  Apartheid had oppressive laws and this chapter shows the cruelty of <br>apartheid as Trevor’s existence was considered a crime.  This meant that Trevor was <br>unable to attend school or play with other children of his own age, as he was termed <br>a threat to the apartheid government's racist ideology.
        <br>
        <br>
        Connecting the issues with my county, Nairobi, there are land issues as Trevor <br>narrates. There is also inequality in churches where different people attend <br>different churches due to their socioeconomic status. This is a problem <br>that should be solved to ensure equality among all citizens.
