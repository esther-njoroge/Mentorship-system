        <br>
        <br>
        Trevor Noah narrates his story through his upbringing in South Africa during  apartheid by <br>his single mother.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        
        He explains apartheid which exploits the tribal differences among the South Africans, the <br>Zulu who were the warrior people, and the Xhosa who termed themselves as thinkers. The <br>Zulu fought the colonial armies while the Xhosa tried learning from them.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        
        Trevor’s mother turns to Christianity where she figures that going to more churches would <br>get her more blessings because they faced challenges due to the racial segregation caused <br>by apartheid. Each church offered different things. Being raised in a Christian household, <br>Trevor  doesn't understand why  they should go to church every Sunday.  Trevor’s mother is <br>guided by church and she can't listen to any of Trevor’s excuses to not go to church. She  is determined to protect her son and keep him safe ; she throws him out of a moving car to save <br>him from a gang attack.
        This is seen in African parents who do anything just to protect their children.
        <br>
        <br>
        Trevor witnessed violence among South Africans trying to figure out which group would rule <br>the country at a young age when Nelson Mandela was released from prison. He was born to a <br>white father and a black mother, which was illegal at that time.  Apartheid had oppressive laws <br>and this chapter shows the cruelty of apartheid as Trevor’s existence was considered a crime.  <br>This meant that Trevor was unable to attend school or play with other children of his own age, <br>as he was termed a threat to the apartheid government's racist ideology.
        <br>
        <br>
        Connecting the issues with my county, Nairobi, there are inequality  issues as Trevor narrates. <br>This is seen in churches where different people attend different churches due to their socioeconomic status. This is a problem that should be solved to ensure equality among all <br>citizens.
