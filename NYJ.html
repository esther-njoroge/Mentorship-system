        <br>
        <br>
        Trevor Noah narrates his story through his upbringing in South Africa during  apartheid <br>by his single mother.
        <br>

        He explains apartheid which exploits the tribal differences among the South <br>Africans, the Zulu who were the warrior people, and the Xhosa who termed themselves <br>as thinkers. The Zulu fought the colonial armies while the Xhosa tried learning from <br>them.

        Trevor’s mother turns to Christianity where she figures that going to more churches <br>would get her more blessings because they faced challenges due to the racial <br>segregation caused by apartheid. Each church offered different things. Being raised in <br>a Christian household, Trevor  doesn't understand why  they should go to church every <br>Sunday.  Trevor’s mother is guided by church and she can't listen to any of Trevor’s excuses <br>to not go to church. She  is determined to protect her son and keep him safe ; she throws him <br>out of a moving car to save him from a gang attack.
        This is seen in African parents who do anything just to protect their children.
        <br>
        <br>
        Trevor witnessed violence among South Africans trying to figure out which group would <br>rule the country at a young age when Nelson Mandela was released from prison. He<br>was born to a white father and a black mother, which was illegal at that time.  Apartheid had oppressive laws and this chapter shows the cruelty of apartheid as Trevor’s existence was considered a crime.  This meant that Trevor was unable to attend school or play with other <br>children of his own age, as he was termed a threat to the apartheid government's racist <br>ideology.
        <br>
        <br>
        Connecting the issues with my county, Nairobi, there are inequality  issues as Trevor narrates. <br>This is seen in churches where different people attend different churches due to <br>their socioeconomic status. This is a problem that should be solved to ensure equality among <br>all citizens.
